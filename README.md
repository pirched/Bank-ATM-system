# Bank-ATM-system
This is my Entry-level project in my first year and semester in University.
Using cpp, the system stores and retrieves data stored in the text files to check for login info and other things.
The system employs an admin to register new users and maintain their data.

#cpp 

To run this system, you will need compilers for this code if you wish to modify it 
But a .exe file is already provided for the existing code
Enjoy
